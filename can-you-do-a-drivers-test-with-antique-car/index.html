<p>Yes you can usually buy a car even if you dont have a drivers license. It is an offence to drive a car without displaying a National Car Testing Service disc if the car is liable for testing. Any car that you use for the driving test must be insured for the learner and for the purpose of the driving test. If you pass your test in an automatic car you are limited to driving vehicles in that category with automatic transmission. This will enable you to chat about issues as they arise during the test drive. You cant use any car on the driving test as some dont give the examiner all-round visionwhich is kind-of important.

<p>If you dont own a car getting your first drivers license can feel like a chicken and egg situation. A few will even allow you to keep the car overnight so that you can see how it fits in your garage as well as get a better feel for it. Test car drivers need a lot of stamina to spend long hours behind the wheel of a car. Buying a classic car is not like buying a regular car. People own cars without driving them all the time. Pickup before your test and drop-off. Pin On Alte Autos Old Cars.</p>

A rating of 96 is good for up to 101 on Steel heads and 121 on Aluminum heads with water cooling.</p>
<h3 id="i-have-heard-a-lot-of-talk-lately-about-avgas-recently-and-want-to-caution-against-the-use-of-this-fuel-in-rs250s">I have heard a lot of talk lately about avgas recently and want to caution against the use of this fuel in RS250s.</h3><p>These problems are exacerbated in lightly driven vintage cars that often have metal fuel tanks that might be poorly sealed due to degraded or missing emissions systems. If your main issue is with synthetic materials being degraded by ethanol rather than lack of lead that may be the better choice. Buying a higher octane for a 20-50K motor is the cheapest insurance available. Many vintage cars now have been retrofitted with hardened bronze valve seats that dont require leaded gas to lubricant them. Currently the two principal types of fuel used in Aviation are Avgas 100LL and Jet A-1.</p>

<p>Avgas LL is about 100 RON and youre probably more likely to get hold of this but the lead. I doesnt run without knocking and valve tapping unless it gets 106 or up octane leaded gas. Buying a higher octane for a 20-50K motor is the cheapest insurance available. This may be true but if you want the most out of your engine and want to avoid problems AvGas may not be your first choice.

<p>In the old days Sunoco high test was the best fuel you could get. Some even replace the air at the top with a sniff of nitrogen. The other thing to consider is using AVAS UL91 which is alcohol free and lead free but probably much closer to the fuel that old vehicles were designed around than EN228 or 100LL.

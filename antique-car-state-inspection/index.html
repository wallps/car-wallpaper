<p>Use the Vehicle Registration Application or the License Plate Application and the Antique Vehicle Applicant Certification. You dont need to nor will you be asked to give mileage per year to the State. The procedure in my state NJ is for the owner to first obtain QQ license plates indicating that the car is registered as an antique. To see the restrictions on the use of antiques or to obtain more information on how to register your vehicle as Antique visit the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles. To avoid inspection you cannot use your antique car for general transportation. You can get an inspection at any of the 1800 licensed inspection stations in Massachusetts from their Inspection Station Locator. Pin On Trains.</p>

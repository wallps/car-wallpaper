<p>Mixing unleaded and super unleaded petrol is safe for you and your car. Unfortunately running vintage cars on contemporary gasoline containing ethanol can create problems for classic car owners.

The main reason clearances could close up to any significant degree over time may be. But its quite costly and involves a major engine overhaul.

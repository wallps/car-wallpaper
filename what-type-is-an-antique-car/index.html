<p>In most cases it is a car thats over 45 years old. In most cases it is a car thats over 45 years old. I had no capacity to refurbish the car myself but luckily I had met a superb restorer in central Massachusetts. Referring to your own particular state laws is again importantmany will require the use of a special license platebut in most cases an antique car is one that is over 45 years old this is the definition used by the Antique Automobile Club of America. Answer 1 of 12. My DMV says any car 20 years old or older is a classic as do most other states. Pin On Original Car Photos.</p>

<p>If you only choose one car from this list to drive this is the one. Namely the state classifies any auto that is more than 25 years old or manufactured after 1915 as an antique motor vehicle. But you probably wont see to many of those running around town with these types. Thats actually not that old when you think about it. A sedan is characterised as a three-box configuration design with four-doors and a closed roof. Fuels containing ethanol produce over 30 less power than older types of petrol so the performance of older cars not built to work with this kind of fuel can suffer.

<p>Thats actually not that old when you think about it. Theres more than one definition of classic car and they can differ greatly. My DMV says any car 20 years old or older is a classic as do most other states. A antique car is simply defined as being over 45 years old. Most states waive those same fees and tests for classic cars also. My car is much like my fathers but with a tan top and whitewalls.

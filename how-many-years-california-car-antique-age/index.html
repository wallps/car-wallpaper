<p>To make the issue more confusing there are also those who consider the phrases classic car and antique car to be synonymous while others use the term antique to describe a car that is at least 20 or 25 years old and classic for cars that have reached 50 years of age. Overall I find this state to be lenient on vintage car ownership. Any car over 45 years old is considered an antique. Its partially a matter of passion. Some may consider newer vehicles to be considered classic and others may not. Ruby Lane an online marketplace of independent antique and collectible shops offers a similar definition explaining Most authorities consider the actual definition of the term antique to mean an age of at least 100 years.

<p>Those who are reputable antique dealers say the 50 years definition lowers the standard to a point that dealers can sell collectibles under the name of antiques. However the legal definitions for the purpose of antique vehicle registration vary widely. Antique cars also should be kept in as close to their original design and specifications as possible. Meanwhile over at Nationwide cars are eligible for classic status if they are at least 20 years old but not more than 40 years old. The vehicle should be roadworthy the body should have no rust the interior should be intact without tears in the upholstery flooring or header. So age is an easy concept to grasp but what does good condition mean. California Kid California Kids Cars Movie Hot Cars.</p>

<p>According to California DMV if the vehicle was manufactured after 1922 and is at least 25 years old it is a Historical Vehicle. This leads us to the word Collectible. On the average though for a car to be considered a Classic Car it must be at least 25 years old and 50 years old for it to be considered an Antique Car. However now due to a change in the rules this only applies to cars built before 1973. Overall I find this state to be lenient on vintage car ownership. The 25-year rule represented a compromise.

<p>Any car over 45 years old is considered an antique. However now due to a change in the rules this only applies to cars built before 1973. Once a vehicle like this is 25 years old it is an antique in State Farms eyes and is no longer eligible for classic car insurance. Some may consider newer vehicles to be considered classic and others may not. The Antique Automobile Club of America defines an antique car as over 25 years of age. Cars older than 25 years have antique status which means no safety inspections and registration renewals spaced out to either 3- or 5-year intervals.

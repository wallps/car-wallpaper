<p>Its hard to notice when furniture gets dusty. Metal cleaners should not be used as they can harm the wood around the mounts. This will deplete the natural oils in the wood. Once youre finished cleaning you can wipe down the furniture with a dry rag. Remove dust and dry stains with a vacuum cleaner or a soft brush attachment every 10-15 days. If the wood has become very dry the wax will soak in rapidly and so should be applied several times until a good patina has developed.

<p>Treat with care. Antique furniture should be waxed on a regular basis as the wax feed protects and nourishes the wood. Todays homes especially are often heated with forced air heat which can tend to dry out furniture quickly. Brass mounts such as handles and other fittings dont have to be ultra-bright on antique furniture. Use a good beeswax based polishÂ Apply the polish leave overnight and then buff. If your house or apartment is especially dry in winter you should use a humidifier. Furniture Care Tips With Christophe Pourny Furniture Care Futuristic Furniture How To Clean Furniture.</p>
